                    <p>The personal website made entirely of vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS. Created by a student in their
                        journey of mastering the art of programming, this website also happens to be open source and
                        accessible for anyone to take a peek at the magnum opus of a code I wrote for this website. I
                        think its pretty readable and understandable(?) Beuh, as if anyone has the guts to even read
                        this mad man's code.</p>

                    <p>This is made for fun. A place to experiment and make cool stuff from the ground up without the
                        help of any framework type shyt. PURE VANILA FOREVER. However... This website is anything BUT
                        professional. Expect compatibility issues with querky choices of browsers. Note this is made by
                        a guy who only needs to use MSEDGE and CHROME, sorry to ya'll opera firefox and other browser
                        users if there's gonna be a TON of weird behavior in this site.</p>

                    <img id="RIGBY" src="./assets/pictures/rigbycat-rigby.gif" alt="rigby pic" title="RIGBY the cat, big fan.">

                    <p>The design principle in this website is independent, fun, and cool. It shouldnt have much
                        dependencies... every asset is hosted by the same github Pages this website is hosted. Images,
                        SVGs, mp3, etc all in one goofy ahh /asset file. I hope this simple site can give some sort of
                        entertainment or even education to anyone of ya'll fortunate souls who would read all the way
                        here, God Bless gng.</p>

                    <p>You hear that ? Thats the magnum opus of a Classical Music Masterpiece by the one and only
                        Antonio Vivaldi, The Four Seasons - Spring - Allegro. Audio file credit to FreeMusicArchive.org</p>

                    <p>And hey this website is free for yall to check the source code in the github repository if ya'll
                        wanna check out the goofy ahh tricks I use to make these. I'm the creator of this website but of
                        course this wouldn't be possible without the assistance of "clever Research and Troubleshooting
                        tools" to help me efficiently learn how to actually make things work and fix the MANY unexpected
                        problems I have to encounter along the way.</p>

                    <p>By "clever Research and Troubleshooting tools" I bet you can pretty much guess what I meant by
                        that. But I wouldnt wanna spend days reading documents of the programming language with
                        technical terms % I've never heard of. Courses take time too to follow through and I only wanna
                        join the one's I trust to actually be able to teach properly. One should never blatantly copy
                        paste code too, I use these tools to literally learn how the code works and how to use it and I
                        implement and integrate that to my website myself.</p>
